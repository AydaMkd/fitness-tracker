# fitness-tracker

This is a simple MERN app where the user can log their workouts and keep track of them. It allows each user to create an account by providing their username and password as well as their name, in order to log or access their workout data. Implementing this authentication code helped us enhance our server side knowledge and learn how to implement secured routes.

We used React for our frontend code and redux to manage React component states. We were able to better understand how react allows us to break down our page sections into different components that interact among each other and we used redux to implement a more flexible state management globally.

We look forward to adding more features to this app, where a user will automatically see their total time workout on their workout log page and change exercise description to a dropdown where the user can have an avatar, pick their workout name rather than typing it and adding more styling.
